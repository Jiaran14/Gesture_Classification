# hello_world
This is my first University assignment using Random Forest and Neural Networks to make classification.
The chosen dataset is the Gesture Phase Segmentation Data Set from UCI. It is composed of 7 raw files and 7 processed files, aiming to identify 5 different gesture phases: rest, preparation, stroke, hold and retraction.
