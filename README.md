This is my first University assignment using Random Forest and Neural Networks to make classification.
The chosen dataset is the Gesture Phase Segmentation Data Set from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gesture+Phase+Segmentation).
It is composed of 7 raw files and 7 processed files, aiming to identify 5 different gesture phases: rest, preparation, stroke, hold and retraction.
